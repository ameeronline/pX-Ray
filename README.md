Pneumonia Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) - Python
This project aims to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Python to analyze X-ray images of
lungs and identify instances of viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia. The CNN will be trained on
a dataset of labeled X-ray images, and will be tested on a separate dataset of unlabeled images to
evaluate its performance in detecting the two types of pneumonia. The goal of this project is to use
machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of pneumonia diagnosis,
potentially helping medical professionals make more accurate and timely treatment decisions.
